//! Lightweight redraw gate.
//!
//! Foreground input always redraws immediately, so it does not need a gate.
//! Background Discord traffic (presence, typing, off-screen messages) is
//! different: most of it does not change what is currently on screen, and
//! redrawing for it just rebuilds an identical frame. To avoid that, we hash the
//! parts of the dashboard that a *background* event can change and only redraw
//! when that hash moves.
//!
//! This deliberately ignores purely input-driven state (scroll offsets,
//! selection indices, which popup is open, composer text, option values): those
//! only change in response to a key or mouse event, which already triggers an
//! immediate redraw. Leaving them out keeps the hash small. Media-cache changes
//! (an inline preview or avatar finishing or failing to load) live outside the
//! dashboard state, so they are handled separately by `effect_forces_redraw`.
