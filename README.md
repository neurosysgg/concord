## Installation

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install concord
```

Or with the tap for the latest version:

```sh
brew install chojs23/tap/concord
```

### npm

```sh
npm install -g @chojs23/concord
```

You can also run Concord without a global install:

```sh
npx @chojs23/concord
```

The npm package installs a prebuilt binary from the GitHub Release artifacts.

### Cargo

Install native dependencies first.

On macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install opus pkg-config
```

On Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install opus-devel alsa-lib-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
```

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libopus-dev libasound2-dev pkg-config
```

```sh
cargo install concord --locked
```

To install without local voice playback and microphone support:

```sh
cargo install concord --locked --no-default-features
```

To install the latest unreleased version directly from the Git repository:

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/chojs23/concord
```

### Nix

Run without installing (requires flakes enabled):

```sh
nix run github:chojs23/concord
```

Install into your profile:

```sh
nix profile install github:chojs23/concord
```

Or add the flake as an input in your own `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.concord.url = "github:chojs23/concord";
}
```

### GitHub Release installer

Install the latest release with the cargo-dist shell installer:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/chojs23/concord/releases/latest/download/concord-installer.sh | sh
```

On Windows, use the PowerShell installer instead:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/chojs23/concord/releases/latest/download/concord-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer places `concord` under `$CARGO_HOME/bin`, which is usually
`~/.cargo/bin` on Unix and `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows.

### Build from source

You need the Rust stable toolchain, Cargo, and the native dependencies listed in
the Cargo install section.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chojs23/concord.git
cd concord
cargo build --release
```

The release binary is produced at:

```sh
target/release/concord
```

To build without local voice playback and microphone support, disable default features:

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

On WSLg, audio is usually exposed through PulseAudio instead of a real ALSA
sound card. If playback does not start, check that PulseAudio and ALSA routing
work before debugging Discord voice itself:

```sh
pactl info
paplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
aplay -D pulse /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

## Features

### Authentication

- **Token** : paste an existing Discord token.
- **Email / Password** : login with credentials. MFA (TOTP, SMS) is fully supported.
- **QR Code** : scan the code from the Discord mobile app.

Email and QR code logins may trigger a CAPTCHA challenge on Discord's side. We cannot solve that, so I strongly recommend using token authentication.

By default, tokens are saved in the system keychain when available. In the
default `auto` mode, Concord falls back to its state directory when keychain
storage is unavailable. See the Security section below for details.

To sign out with the default keys, open your profile with `Space`, `p`, then
choose `[o] Sign out`.

### Guilds & Channels

- Browse servers with guild folder grouping
- Navigate text channels, threads, and forum channels
- View, filter, and create forum/media posts (active / archived)
- Create, edit, follow, close, lock, pin, and delete threads and forum posts
- Switch channels, threads, and posts with the fuzzy channel switcher (`Space`, `Space`)
- Load pinned messages per channel
- Open channel actions for pinned messages, thread lists, and mark-as-read
- Join and leave voice channels/DM calls
- Highlight active voice speakers in voice channel/DM calls
- Track unread messages and mention counts per channel
- Mute and unmute channels and servers
- Leave the selected server after confirmation

### Messaging

- Send, edit, and delete messages
- Upload / Download attachments
- Search messages with filters with `/`
- Use @mention autocomplete
- Use custom emoji from other servers when your account supports it
- Send custom emoji your account cannot use directly as image links when enabled
- View full message history
- Rich content display (embeds, attachments, stickers, and mentions)
- Detect URLs in message bodies and markdown links, then open them in your default browser
- Direct message shortcuts for copy, reply, edit, delete, reactions, URL opening,
  and image viewing. More message actions are available from the action menu.

#### Markdown Rendering & Code syntax highlighting

![Markdown rendering example](./docs/markdown-example.png)

Concord renders a practical subset of Discord-style Markdown in message bodies:

- Headings: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- Quotes: `> quoted text`
- Bullets: `- item` and `* item`
- Inline styles: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, and `` `inline code` ``
- Fenced code blocks with optional language labels, rendered as compact boxes
  with syntax highlighting
- Raw URLs and markdown link destinations are underlined and can be opened from message actions

### Reactions & Polls

- View, add, and remove emoji reactions (Unicode and custom server emoji)
- Use custom emoji from other servers as reactions when your account supports it
- Browse who reacted with a specific emoji
- View and vote on polls

### Media & Images

Image rendering is powered by [ratatui-image](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image). On startup, Concord queries the terminal to detect the best available graphics protocol. Supported protocols:

- **Kitty Graphics Protocol** - Kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty, etc.
- **iTerm2 Inline Images** - iTerm2, WezTerm, mintty, etc.
- **Sixel** - foot, mlterm, xterm (if compiled with Sixel support), etc.
- **Halfblocks** (fallback) - works on any terminal, but uses block characters instead of true pixels.

If your terminal does not support any graphics protocol, images will be rendered as halfblock approximations. For the best experience, use a terminal that supports the Kitty or iTerm2 protocol.

You can toggle image viewing on or off in the configuration file. When image viewing is off, attachments and emojis will be shown as text placeholders.

Video playback uses [mpv](https://mpv.io/). Make sure `mpv` is installed and in your PATH.
YouTube playback depends on your local `mpv` setup, such as `yt-dlp` support.

### Members & Profiles

- Member list with grouping
- Search members in server
- Presence indicators (Online, Idle, DND, Offline)
- Configure user profile and custom activity status

### Typing Indicators & Read State

- Live "user is typing..." indicators
- Unread message tracking with mention counts
- Mark server, channel as read

### Notifications

- Notification inbox (`<leader>n`) with Unreads and Mentions tabs, per-channel
  message previews, and mark-as-read / mark-all-read
- You can configure notification sounds with custom WAV files
- Desktop notifications for messages that pass your Discord
  notification settings
- Voice join and leave notification sounds while you are connected to voice

### Navigation & Keyboard shortcuts

> ⚠️ Keymap action names and default bindings may have breaking changes between releases.

All default key settings in this section can be customized. See
[Keymap options](./docs/keymap-options.md) for the config format and supported
actions.

Concord has a four-pane.
**Guilds (1)**, **Channels (2)**, **Messages (3)**, **Members (4)**

With default vim-style navigation:

#### Mention picker

When the @mention picker is open, use `Up` / `Down`,
`Ctrl+p` / `Ctrl+n`, `Tab`, or `Enter` to choose a mention.

#### Emoji picker

Type `:` plus at least two letters, such as `:he`, to pick Unicode, server, or
cross-server custom emoji while writing a message.

When `emojis_as_links` is enabled, custom emoji your account cannot send
directly are inserted as Discord image links instead.

To react from the composer, select a message, enter insert mode, then type
`+:`. The reaction picker opens for that message. Press `/` to search, Enter to
lock the filter, then Enter again or use a shown shortcut to react.

#### Bot commands

When the composer input starts with a slash `/`, the command suggestion popup

## Configuration

Concord options are stored under Concord's config directory. If
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, Concord uses `config.toml` for app options and `keymap.toml` for key settings.
Otherwise it uses the platform config directory.

Local UI state and plaintext fallback credentials are stored under Concord's
state directory instead. If `XDG_STATE_HOME` is set, Concord uses
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/concord/state.toml` and
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/concord/credentials.toml`. Otherwise it uses
`~/.local/state/concord/state.toml` and
`~/.local/state/concord/credentials.toml`.

You can change some configuration from the in-app Options menu, and Concord saves them back
to `config.toml`. Key settings are read from `keymap.toml`.

`image_protocol`:

- `auto`: use terminal detection. In iTerm, Concord uses the iTerm2 protocol
  because terminal capability detection can incorrectly select Kitty there.
- `iterm2`: force the iTerm2 inline image protocol.
- `kitty`: force the Kitty graphics protocol.
- `sixel`: force Sixel rendering.
- `halfblocks`: force Unicode half-block fallback rendering.

`image_preview_quality` and `attachment_viewer_quality`:

- `efficient`: smaller preview requests to reduce bandwidth and memory use.
- `balanced`: default quality with bounded resource use.
- `high`: sharper resized previews using lossless quality.
- `original`: request the original source image for previews when possible.

This setting only applies to attachment, embed, and attachment viewer previews.
Avatars and custom emoji keep their separate small-image behavior.

`credentials.store`:

- `auto`: try the system keychain first, then fall back to the state-file credential store.
- `keychain`: use only the system keychain. If keychain storage is unavailable, the token is not saved.
- `plain`: use only the plain-text state-file credential store.

## Performance

Concord is designed to stay lightweight in normal terminal use. In observed
typical use, it usually uses about 20-40 MB of memory.

Image-heavy screens can temporarily use more memory because compressed image
bytes need to be decoded before they can be rendered in the terminal. When many
images are loaded, memory can briefly rise to around 100-200 MB while decoding
and then drop again as work completes and caches are pruned.

To keep resource usage bounded, Concord limits media work in several places:

- Attachment previews are downloaded with an 8 MiB per-preview cap.
- Up to 4 attachment previews are fetched at once.
- Up to 2 inline image previews are decoded at once.
- Inline image previews, avatars, and custom emoji use small LRU caches.
- Image preview requests prefer resized Discord proxy URLs sized for the
  terminal instead of original full-size media when possible.
- The preview quality preset can lower preview source dimensions or opt into
  original source images. It does not change avatar or custom emoji sizing.

Message history is also cached with a per-channel limit, so long-running
sessions do not keep every message in memory forever.

## FAQ

### Can my account be blocked?

Honestly, no.

There are some path that did trigger a account block:

- Trying to **create a new DM channel and send a message to an unknown user**(meaning there was no pre-existing DM created through the Discord client) can immediately block your account temporarily.
- Some features that requires a hCapcha challenge on Discord's side.

Other features have not caused blocks in my testing.

That said, Concord is not an official Discord client. Using unofficial clients, automated user accounts, or self-bots can violate Discord's TOS, so there is always some risk. Use it at your own discretion.

### Does Concord support CAPTCHA?

No. If Discord requires a CAPTCHA during login, use token login instead.

## Security

- By default, tokens are stored in the system keychain when available.
- On Linux, keychain storage uses Secret Service when a compatible service is available.
- In `credentials.store = "auto"`, Concord falls back to **plain text** credentials under Concord's state directory when keychain storage is unavailable. In `keychain` mode, Concord does not fall back to plain storage. Keep fallback credential files secure and do not share them. You can use a token from that file to log in to the official Discord client, so treat it like a password.
- On Unix, the fallback credential's parent directory is created with `0700` and the credential file with `0600` permissions.
